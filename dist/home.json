Our labor built our capital city, it's time WE benefit from it! No longer should the rich elites hoard our housing for profit. No longer will we toil for meager wages and suffer without so our kids can eat! The power has always been in our hands--we only need to come together to reclaim it!</strong></p><p><strong>With that in mind we ask that everyone in the service industry unite into a mass workers union and for their communities to form councils which stand behind the unions in solidarity. Please read the content on our page and in our publication, <a href='https://www.thecapitalworker.com/Articles'>The Capital Worker</a>, for more strategic and educational content.</strong></p>"

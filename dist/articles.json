        "content": "<h2>The Labor History of Jefferson City, MO: A Legacy of Struggle and the Need for Reclamation</h2><p>The Foundation of Jefferson City: Built by Labor, Exploited by Power. Jefferson City, Missouri, owes its very foundation to the tireless efforts of its labor force. The city’s infrastructure, economy, and growth were all made possible by the hardworking men and women who toiled in its factories, construction sites, and railways. But as these workers built the city, they were subjected to grueling exploitation, enduring harsh working conditions for minimal pay, all while facing intense pressure from employers and a lack of meaningful support from the unions that were supposed to protect them.</p><h3>The AFL and the Rise of Craft Unions</h3><p>In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the American Federation of Labor (AFL) established itself as the dominant labor organization in the United States. The AFL focused on organizing skilled workers into craft unions, which were exclusive groups based on specific trades. In Jefferson City, as in many other places, these craft unions often prioritized the interests of their skilled members over those of the broader working class.</p><p>These unions were designed to serve their own individual interests, creating a divide between skilled and unskilled workers. This division weakened the overall labor movement, as it fragmented the working class, preventing a united front against the common enemy: the ruling class. Over time, the unions that developed out of this framework began to reflect the priorities of the AFL, which were often more aligned with maintaining a stable relationship with employers rather than challenging the status quo.</p><h3>The Consequences for the Broader Working Class</h3><p>The craft unions' focus on specific trades meant that the broader working class—especially unskilled laborers—was often left without adequate representation. These workers, who were the backbone of Jefferson City's economy, were forced to endure dangerous working conditions, long hours, and low wages without the protection or support they desperately needed. The AFL’s reluctance to engage in broader class struggle allowed employers to continue exploiting these workers, leaving the ruling class secure in the knowledge that the unions were too divided to mount an effective resistance.</p><h3>The Role of Unions in Protecting Workers’ Rights</h3><p>Despite these challenges, unions in Jefferson City still played a crucial role in advocating for workers' rights. Many of these unions, especially those influenced or led by more socially conscious organizations, such as the IWW and others, recognized that the only way to achieve meaningful change was through solidarity and collective action. They organized strikes, fought for fair wages, and demanded better working conditions. These laborers understood that their strength lay in their unity, and they were willing to fight, bleed, and even die to secure the rights that we often take for granted today.</p><p>The legacy of these struggles is evident in the labor rights we enjoy today—rights that were hard-won through decades of struggle, sacrifice, and perseverance. However, the systematic dismantling of unions over the years has left the labor movement in a weakened state, unable to effectively protect the interests of workers in the face of growing corporate power.</p><h3>Reclaiming the Unions: A Call to Action</h3><p>Today, the unions that once protected workers' rights have been systematically weakened by the powers that be. The ruling class has used legislation, propaganda, and economic pressure to break up unions and render them nearly powerless. As a result, workers in Jefferson City and across the country are once again facing exploitation, with little recourse to protect themselves.</p><p>But this does not have to be our fate. The unions are still the only ready-made force capable of protecting the interests of the working class. What we need is a change in leadership—a shift away from the bureaucrats who have grown too comfortable in their positions, and toward leaders who are committed to the original purpose of the labor movement: to fight for the rights and dignity of all workers.</p><h3>A Vision for the Future: Union Councils and Workers’ Democracy</h3><p>The future of the American labor movement lies in the hands of the workers themselves. It is time to reclaim the unions and transform them into powerful instruments of change. This can be achieved through the establishment of union councils in every industry and area of life, councils that are democratically controlled by the workers themselves. These councils would serve as the backbone of a true workers’ democracy, where decisions are made based on the needs of the people, not the pursuit of profit.</p><p>Jefferson City has a rich history of cooperation and togetherness, and it is time to draw on that strength. By coming together, regardless of our cultural, racial or sexual identities, we can harness the greatest force on earth: the collective power of the working class. If we rise up together, we can remove the few who hoard our resources from power. By dismantling the profit motive and distributing goods based on need rather than profit, we can build a society where everyone has access to the resources they need to live a dignified life.</p><p>This vision is not a utopian dream; it is a practical solution rooted in the history of labor struggle. The laborers who built Jefferson City understood that they could only achieve progress through unity and collective action. Today, we must honor their legacy by continuing their fight, by reclaiming the unions, and by building a future where the working class is in control of its own destiny.</p>"

        "title": "The Dems Shift to Harris: A Tactical Move",
        "content": "<h2>The Democratic Shift to Harris: A Tactical Move and What It Means for the Working Class</h2>.<h3>A Tactical Shift: The Democrats' Move to Harris.</h3><p>As the political landscape in the United States continues to shift, the Democratic Party has made a strategic move by elevating Kamala Harris as the figurehead for the presidential ticket with a focus on appealing to the working class. This maneuver is not just a reaction to internal party dynamics; it is a calculated effort to win back voters who might otherwise turn to Trump out of disdain for Biden or disengage from the electoral process altogether.</p><p>Harris, who presents herself as a champion of the working class, is part of a broader Democratic strategy to co-opt the growing wave of discontent among workers, particularly the younger generations who are increasingly disillusioned with the traditional workforce. These young people see through the façade of opportunity offered by a system that only exploits their time and energy—their very lives—while giving little in return. Many have rejected this system altogether, opting out of a workforce that they view as inherently exploitative and backwards.</p><h3>The Implications of This Shift.</h3><p>On the surface, this shift may seem like a positive development for workers. After all, the rhetoric of concern for the working class is what many want to hear from their political leaders. But we must ask ourselves: where does this leave us? Can we truly expect meaningful change from a party that has consistently prioritized the interests of the conglomerates over those of the people?</p><p>Even as the Democrats position themselves as the party of the working class, we must remember that their history tells a different story. Neither party—Democrat nor Republican—has shown genuine concern for the struggles of the working class. Both have repeatedly lied to us, using our votes to maintain their power while continuing to pursue policies that benefit the wealthy and powerful. This latest move by the Democrats could be a significant setback for workers' rights movements if we allow ourselves to be fooled by their rhetoric.</p><h3>The Reality of the Workforce.</h3><p>Let’s face the reality of today’s workforce. We desperately need service workers, industry workers, and STEM professionals. These roles are essential to the functioning of our society. But everywhere we turn, we encounter more and more exploitation. Even those fortunate enough to claw their way into the tech industry—a sector often hailed as a path to success—find themselves facing the same exploitative practices that plague other industries.</p><p>The move to Harris is designed to placate us, to make us believe that the Democrats have our best interests at heart. But the truth is, they are simply trying to dampen the revolutionary fervor that is spreading among the working class. They see the writing on the wall—a new generation of workers who are no longer willing to sacrifice their lives for a system that doesn’t value them. By positioning themselves as the champions of the working class, the Democrats hope to co-opt this energy and redirect it back into the same broken system.</p><h3>Don’t Be Fooled: The War Machine Rolls On.</h3><p>We must not forget that while the Democrats may talk about workers’ rights, they continue to engage in the same imperialist policies that have defined U.S. foreign policy for decades. Proxy wars, initiated and sustained in the interest of U.S. hegemony, continue to broaden markets for American conglomerates and create new opportunities for profit. And who pays the price? We, the workers, do. We pay with our taxes, our labor, and, too often, with our lives.</p><p>Meanwhile, our working-class brothers and sisters around the globe are slaughtered in these wars, pitted against each other in conflicts that serve only the interests of the conglomerates that funded, fueled, and narrated the war. Do we see any benefit from these conflicts? We would never want to benefit from atrocity but the answer is a resounding no. Instead, we watch as the rich grow richer, while we are left to deal with the fallout—both at home and abroad.</p><h3>A Call to Unity.</h3><p>So, my working-class siblings, whatever you do, don’t fall for the rhetoric coming from either side of the political aisle. Gather together, discuss these issues with one another, and analyze the situation critically. Understand that we need to stand united against this system of exploitation and murder. The only way forward is through solidarity and collective action. We must reclaim the power that rightfully belongs to us, the workers, and build a future that serves the needs of the many, not the few.</p>"

        "title": "A System Rigged Against Us",
        "content": "<h2>A System Rigged Against Us: The Exploitation of the Working Class</h2><h3>The Status Quo and the Powers That Be</h3><p>In the heartland of America, where values of hard work and resilience run deep, the working class has long shouldered the burdens of an economy that seems to thrive on their exploitation. The powers that be—the giants of industry and finance—reap massive profits, while those who fuel their wealth struggle to make ends meet. The system, designed to protect and grow the profits of these conglomerates, fails to represent the needs of the very people who keep it running: the workers.</p><h3>Reforms That Failed Us</h3><p>Consider the 2008 housing crisis, a devastating blow to millions of Americans. Families lost their homes, their savings, and their security. Did the working class receive the support they needed? Were there comprehensive measures to protect those who were hit hardest? The answer is a resounding no. Meanwhile, the financial conglomerates responsible for the crisis were bailed out, their profits secured, and their executives rewarded. Fast forward to 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic brought the world to its knees. The working class was declared 'essential', yet what did that title really mean? A brief moratorium on evictions, a few months of extra unemployment benefits, and then what? As soon as those meager supports were stripped away, workers were left to fend for themselves, plunged back into the chaos of paycheck-to-paycheck living. Meanwhile, the powers that be—the conglomerates—saw their profits triple. They thrived while we barely survived.</p><h3>Divide and Conquer: The Weapon of Identity Politics</h3><p>In times of crisis, instead of uniting us, the powers that be use every tool at their disposal to divide us. Identity politics, once a means to amplify the voices of marginalized groups, has been weaponized to keep us fractured. The divisions along lines of race, gender, sexual orientation, and personal identity are stoked and amplified until we're too emotional, too confused, and too exhausted to recognize the real enemy: the system itself. This isn't to dismiss the importance of identity, but to highlight how our differences are exploited to keep us weak and disunited.</p><h3>What Is Required of Us</h3><p>The status quo, as it stands, is unsustainable for the working class, and the earth. A system that prioritizes profit over people is one that cannot, and will not, serve the interests of the majority. The time has come for us to recognize the failures of reforms, to see that the system is not broken, but functioning exactly as it was designed—to benefit the few at the expense of the many.</p><p>If we are to change this, we must begin by reconnecting with one another, by recognizing that our strength lies in our unity. We must see through the smoke and mirrors of identity politics used to divide us and focus on the common struggles we all face. The fight is not against each other, but against the powers that be—a fight for a system that truly represents and protects the interests of the working class.</p><p>This is our call to action. The working class has always been the backbone of this country. It is time we reclaim our power, our communities, and our future.</p>"

        "title": "The Non-Partisan Exploitation of the Working Class",
        "content": "<h2>The Non-Partisan Exploitation of the Working Class</h2><p>It’s a hard truth that many politicians, regardless of their partisan labels, are united in one thing: their disregard for the well-being of the working class when it comes to protecting the interests of the conglomerates. Whether they wear the badge of a Democrat or a Republican, their loyalty to the profit-driven system often overshadows any genuine concern for the people they claim to represent.</p><h2>A Conflict of Interests</h2><p>A politician cannot serve both the working class and the conglomerates simultaneously. The very nature of profit-seeking is at odds with the needs of people. Time and again, we’ve seen that where profit is the motive, human lives, livelihoods, and well-being take a backseat. This is not just a partisan issue; it is a systemic one. It doesn’t matter if the politician is red or blue, conservative or liberal—when they enter the halls of power, they are often seduced by the wealth and influence that come with playing the game of the conglomerates.</p><h3>The Reality Behind the Rhetoric</h3><p>Politicians like Bernie Sanders and members of The Squad may appear to genuinely push for better conditions for the working class. However, even their efforts are hampered by a system where profit remains the bottom line. Legislation, no matter how well-intentioned, is often compromised by hidden clauses and amendments that favor corporate interests. This is the reality of how politics operates in a system that prioritizes profit above all else.</p><p>Look closely at any major piece of legislation, and you’ll likely find provisions that serve the interests of wealthy donors and corporations. These are often buried in the fine print, slipped in during late-night sessions, or tacked onto bills that ostensibly benefit the public. This deceptive practice is part of the politician’s toolkit, ensuring that while they may publicly champion the working class, they continue to serve the conglomerates behind the scenes.</p><h3>Sensationalized Politics and Profits</h3><p>The political theater we witness during election cycles—filled with sensationalized debates, exaggerated rivalries, and outrageous claims—is more than just a distraction. It is a lucrative enterprise. Elections have become multi-billion-dollar spectacles, where the media, campaign consultants, and corporations make vast profits. The issues that truly matter to the working class are sidelined in favor of entertainment value, keeping us engaged but ultimately powerless.</p><h3>The Call for a Working-Class Party</h3><p>There is no workers' democracy in the USA. Politicians, whether Republican or Democrat, are disconnected from the realities of the working class. They do not understand what’s best for us because they have no genuine concern beyond how much profit they can extract from us. What we need is a working-class party—a party that is not beholden to corporate interests, that does not prioritize profit over people, and that truly represents the needs and aspirations of the working class.</p><p>It is time to move beyond the false choices offered by the current political system. It is time to build a movement that speaks for all of us, not just the wealthy and powerful. The future of the working class depends on our ability to organize, to unite, and to demand a system that serves our interests, not theirs.</p>"

        "title": "Organize for Power: Form a Mass Service Workers Union",
        "content": "<h2>Organize for Power: Form a Mass Service Workers Union</h2><p>Working in the service industry, whether it's waiting tables, stocking shelves, or running a cash register, means one thing is constant: hard work. It's the kind of work that keeps the gears of our communities running, yet too often, service workers face low wages, unpredictable hours, and few, if any, benefits. But here's the truth: things don't have to stay this way. By coming together and organizing, you can create real, lasting change for yourself and your fellow workers.</p><p>Below is a step-by-step guide on how to organize a mass service workers union, rooted in the lessons of union history and its struggles. The strategy has been time-tested in industries like manufacturing, auto, and mining, and can be just as effective in today's service economy.</p><h2>Start with Conversations</h2><p>The first step to organizing a union is simple: talk. Start with a few trusted coworkers, friends, neighbors, or even family members who also work in service jobs. Share your frustrations, but more importantly, share your vision of what things could look like if workers banded together. Do you want fair wages, consistent scheduling, better health benefits? Lay it out plainly. A few honest conversations can snowball into something bigger.</p><p><strong>Tip:</strong> Keep it low-key at first. Not everyone will be immediately on board, and that’s okay. Focus on building trust and solidarity one conversation at a time.</p><h2>Build a Core Group</h2><p>Once you’ve got a few people who agree that something needs to change, form a core group. This group should represent different parts of the service industry in your area. If you’re in a small town, this could mean people from local grocery stores, restaurants, and retail shops. The more diverse your group, the better you’ll understand the unique challenges faced across different sectors.</p><p>The core group’s goal is twofold:</p><ul><li>Establish shared priorities (higher wages, benefits, job security, etc.).</li><li>Expand the conversation to more coworkers, friends, and community members.</li></ul><h2>Map Out the Workplaces</h2><p>Your next step is to identify key workplaces in your community. Think of it as a blueprint of the service industry in your area. Is there a local chain of diners? Several convenience stores? Do many people work for the same big-box retailer? Understanding where the service workers are concentrated will help you figure out where to focus your efforts. This is especially important in rural communities, where jobs may be scattered across multiple small businesses.</p><p><strong>Tip:</strong> You don’t have to start by organizing an entire county or town. Start small, focus on one workplace or even one department, and grow from there.</p><h2>Create a Plan for Action</h2><p>Your core group should now focus on putting together a clear plan. What will it take to bring more workers on board? How will you address their concerns? Here’s where organizing can become strategic:</p><ul><li>Hold regular meetings with a growing group of coworkers to talk about what’s working and what’s not. These meetings can be in person or online—whatever works best for everyone’s schedules.</li><li>Stay flexible and ready to adapt. Each workplace may have different concerns, and the needs of workers at a local restaurant might be different from those at a gas station.</li><li>Set realistic goals. Start by winning small improvements—better schedules, fairer treatment—and use those victories to build momentum.</li></ul><h2>Know Your Rights</h2><p>As you organize, it’s essential to know your legal rights as workers. Even in non-union workplaces, you have the right to discuss your wages and working conditions with coworkers and to organize collectively. It’s worth researching labor laws in your state to ensure that you stay within legal boundaries while organizing. If you’re not sure where to start, there are plenty of online resources and organizations that can help guide you.</p><h2>Form a Union Committee</h2><p>Once you’ve built a strong base of support, it’s time to take the next big step: forming a union committee. This committee will represent workers at the negotiating table, working directly with employers to advocate for better conditions.</p><p>If your employer is resistant—and many will be—it’s important to remain united and prepared. Remember, workers have power when they stick together. Employers rely on workers to keep their businesses running, and that gives you leverage. Whether you work at a fast-food joint or a retail giant, the power to disrupt operations gives you bargaining power.</p><h2>Get Support from the Community</h2><p>In rural areas, the community is often tight-knit. Use this to your advantage. The service workers’ union isn’t just about improving conditions for workers—it’s about making life better for everyone. When service workers are paid fair wages and treated with respect, the entire community benefits. Talk to local customers, church groups, or other community organizations about your efforts. Most people will be supportive when they see that your goal is to create a fairer, more stable local economy.</p><h2>Stay the Course</h2><p>Organizing isn’t easy. It takes time, persistence, and sometimes, sacrifice. But the rewards—a better life for you, your family, and your community—are worth the struggle. Remember that this is about building long-term power. One step at a time, you can create a service workers union that fights for your rights and transforms your workplace.</p><h2>Conclusion: Unity is Strength</h2><p>We’ve seen it throughout history: when workers stand together, they can change the course of industries, economies, and even entire nations. You don’t have to accept low wages and poor conditions. You can organize with your neighbors, coworkers, and friends to form a mass service workers union. Together, you can win the respect, wages, and dignity you deserve.</p><p>Now is the time to act. Start those conversations, form your core group, and organize for a better tomorrow. Remember, the power lies in your hands—and in your unity.</p>"
